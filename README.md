#C2 Security Application Client

##Introduction

The C2 Security Application Client is a part of a command and control (C2) infrastructure designed to monitor and interact with endpoint devices securely. This client application communicates with the server to receive commands, send device information, and manage watchlist statuses, ensuring devices remain compliant with the monitoring system. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and supports WebSocket communication for real-time command execution.


##Architecture Overview (optional)

The client uses a multi-threaded architecture combined with asynchronous WebSocket communication to handle server commands and respond in real-time. The GUI is built using Tkinter, and the networking logic leverages Pythonâ€™s asyncio and websockets libraries.

##How to Use

###Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.10 or above is required.
Dependencies: Install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have Tkinter installed, as it is required for the GUI. You might need to install it separately depending on your OS.

##Build

The client application does not require a separate build step. Make sure the dependencies are installed, and you have the necessary environment variables set up if required.

##Test

Unit and integration tests can be run using pytest. Make sure all dependencies are installed, and then execute:


pytest

This will run all available tests and provide a summary of any issues.

##Run

To run the client application:

Make sure the server is running and accessible.
Execute the following command:

python client.py
The application will start, connect to the server, and the GUI will appear for interaction.
